            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you can. Cut into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Place about 2 teaspoons meat filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm. Stir together yogurt and minced garlic in a small bowl and set aside.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle each serving with warm red pepper oil.</p>
